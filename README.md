## Context

This tool is viewed as the deliverable for the course *Artificial Intelligence in Business* that takes place at the *Kozminski University* as part of their International Summer School 2025 program.

As I created this with the intention for other students to use this as functional example and inspiration I have also created a [ReadMe file for people who are complete beginners at programming](./beginners.md) as I think this task will be almost impossible to do in just a week for those people.

## Requirements

Python version: 3.12.11 (other versions might be compatible but no guarantee)
